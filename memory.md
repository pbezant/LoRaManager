# LoRaManager Development Memory

## Implementation Decisions

- **2023-10-15**: Chose C++ class-based approach over C-style functions for better encapsulation of device state
- **2023-10-20**: Implemented builder pattern for device configuration to improve API usability
- **2023-11-02**: Separated connection management from device control to allow multiple connection profiles
- **2023-11-18**: Added event callback system rather than polling for more efficient operation
- **2023-12-10**: Created examples directory structure for different use cases (Basic, Class B, Class C)

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Device initialization failures**: Added robust error detection and reporting
- **Message queue overflow**: Implemented priority-based message handling
- **Connection loss**: Added automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Packet corruption**: Added CRC verification and retry mechanism
- **Power failures during transmission**: Implemented message persistence

## Problems Solved

- **Memory constraints**: Optimized payload formatting to reduce RAM usage
- **Timing issues**: Created precise timing controls for Class B beacon synchronization
- **Interference detection**: Added channel monitoring and automatic frequency adjustment
- **Battery optimization**: Implemented sleep modes and duty cycling
- **Regional compliance**: Added configuration profiles for different LoRaWAN regions

## Rejected Approaches

- **Single global instance**: Rejected in favor of multiple instantiable objects for multi-device support
- **Polling-based reception**: Rejected due to inefficient CPU usage; implemented callbacks instead
- **String-based API**: Rejected due to memory overhead; used enums and structured data instead
- **Blocking operations**: Rejected in favor of non-blocking API to prevent hanging the main loop
- **Fixed payload size**: Rejected in favor of variable message sizes to optimize airtime
